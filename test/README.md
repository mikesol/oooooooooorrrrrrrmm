To add migrations to the test, run a command like:

OPENAI_API_KEY=<my-key> pnpm spago run -- ts --path test/typescript/io-ts -m test/migrations -q test/queries -v io-ts

This is equivalent to:

 OPENAI_API_KEY=<my-key> oooooooooorrrrrrrmm ts --path test/typescript/io-ts -m test/migrations -q test/queries -v io-ts
